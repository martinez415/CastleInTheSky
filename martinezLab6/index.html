            <h2>Film Development</h2>
            <div>
                <p>At the time of production, the animated film had a budget of ¥500 million (or $3,000,000). This 
                    matched the record set by an earlier Miyazki film <i>“The Castle of Cagliostro”</i> released in 1979. The 
                    film was released in Japan on August 2, 1986. At the box office, it grossed ¥1.6 billion ($8,100,000). 
                    The film has multiple release and re-releases in countries such as China, France, the United Kingdom 
                    and the United States and accumulated combined worldwide box office gross of around $16,065,703</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hide">
                <p> Prior to the development of <i>“Castle in the Sky”</i>, Miyazaki created the anime series <i>“Future Boy Conan”</i>, 
                    which served as inspiration and featured elements which he adapted for Laputa. Characters served as 
                    references and plots had similarities to the film. The name “Luputa” is derived from the novel <i>“Gullivers 
                    Travels"</i> by Jonathan Swift. In the novel, Laputa is “flying island propelled by a giant central crystal and 
                    controlled by its citizens.” Critics reference the novel to the film due to their similarities, citing both 
                    explore concepts of technology, political control, and magical realism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, Miyazaki took inspiration from Welsh architecture. This can be seen in the beginning of the 
                    film where we are first introduced to Pazu as he is working and notices Sheeta floating down into the mine 
                    he is working in. While visiting the country in 1984, the director visited mining towns and witnessed a 
                    labor strike by local miners. Reflecting on this experience, Miyazaki said: <i><b>“I was in Wales just after the 
                    miners' strike. I really admired the way the miners' unions fought to the very end for their jobs and 
                    communities, and I wanted to reflect the strength of those communities in my film."</b></i> He continues that the 
                    miners reminded him a similar events which took place in his native Japan.
